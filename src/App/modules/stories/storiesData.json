    "description": "Our group’s trip to Saint Martin was like living in a watercolor painting. The sound of waves crashing as we strolled along the coral-lined beaches was therapeutic. We enjoyed fresh seafood, watched the sunset with coconut water in hand, and camped under a sky full of stars. I’ll never forget how peaceful it felt to disconnect from the mainland.",
